                    I am a young researcher who aspires to inspire :), striving to have a positive impact in the field of Natural Language 
                    Processing (NLP). In my free time, I love to volunteer. Given my strong 
                    desire and passion to increase the active participation of women and young 
                    girls in STEM fields and above all demystify Artificial intelligence (AI) in 
                    my home country, together with my friends, I founded the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmer-ai-ba7712191" target="_blank">KmerAI</a> 
                     community, and co-founded <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/women-promoting-science-to-the-younger-association-661a5317b" target="_blank">WPSYG</a>
                      (Women Promoting Sciences to the Younger Generation) association. In addition to that, 
                      I am equally a co-organizer for the Women in Machine Learning & Data Sciences (<a href="http://wimlds.org/" target="_blank">WiMLDS</a>), 
                      Yaoundé <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wimlds-yaounde" target="_blank">chapter</a> , Chapter Lead for the Omdena <a href="https://omdena.com/omdena-chapter-page-cameroon/" target="_blank">Cameroon local chapter</a>,
                      and a volunteer at <a href="https://blackinai.github.io/#/" target="_blank">Black in AI</a>. 
                      I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (minor) from 
                      the University of Buea, Cameroon and two Master's degree - one in Big Data and Computer security, 
                      and the other in Information and Data processing from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), 
                      Senegal and the University of Paris Saclay, France respectively. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM) in partnership with the De Vinci Research Center (DVRC) 
		      and the company Coexel. My work was at the intersection of graphs and NLP for recommender systems. The main objective of my work was to define 
		      an optimized system for information retrieval and recommendation of technological development. I listen to music a lot, and I love singing and 
		      dansing. My favorite sports are tennis, ping pong and volleyball.
